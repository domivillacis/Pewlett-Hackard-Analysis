# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

I am collaborating on this analysis with Pewlette Hackard, a leading technology company, which has been in the market for many years but is currently undergoing a phase of personnel changes; the company has several thousand employees, many of whom are soon to retire.

Therefore, I will help Bobby, an HR analyst, find highly relevant data on how many employees are about to retire and how many new talents can be hired so that the company maintains its high quality and prestige and, above all, to ensure its future.

We are going to use SQL (Structure Query Language) for this project, which is a data query language that will allow us to organize, manipulate, manage and merge data storage in databases.
